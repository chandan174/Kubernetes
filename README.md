Kubernetes is usually defined as a container orchestration platform.

Now before proceeding lets understand what is container, docker and how it differs from kubernetes.

** Containers : Containers are light weight packages of software which contain all the dependecies required to run that software in any env.
    They are light weight and differ from VM , as each VM has a full OS but in case of container they share a base OS image and uses the host OS as its own.
